### Hi there 👋

<h1>Welcome to my github profile<h1>
<h4>Hi, my name is Harry<h4>
<h4>I'm a student<h4>
<h5>I want to study computer science or electrical engineering in the future<h5>
<h4>For now I know how to program in C and Python<h4>
<h5>Currently I'm learning about Java and more about OOP<h5>
<p>I've created a few projects in this repository to experimented with things I've learned about or projects I'm interested in. I'm also learning about how to use Github at the same time</p>
